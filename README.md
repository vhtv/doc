<img src=banner.jpg alt="Vladmir Chmil"/>

Hi all VHTV fans! I am Vladimir Chmil, lead developer of Voyeur House TV. 

We are pleased to announce that VHTV will be officially open source software soon! 

Why we do this? First, our goal is transparency. An open source code allows the people to see how VHTV works from inside and what types of data are transmitted. Also, this brings an invaluable opportunity to the community to contribute to our code, help us improve, and ultimately join us in our effort to make the best voyeur site in the world.

We will publish almost all source code of our project in our github account at the end of October.

https://github.com/vhtv/

Follow us on GitHub, give stars to us, and even fork our code. If you do not have GitHub account - today is the best time to join the largest IT community in the world!

What you will see:
- source code of our site (both backend and frontend)
- router firmware (we build it from scratch using buildroot!)
- our private fork of OpenVPN
- moments, control panel and other auxilary sites

No private data of our customers is subject to be published. Do not worry.

By the end of the next week, we are going to publish an article about technical stack used in VHTV to habr.com (in Russian). In this article, we are going to tell the community how a voyeur project looks "under the hood".

In addition to this, we are starting a bug bounty. If you see a security bug, you can communicate it to me via my telegram @ulv8888 and we add from 7 to 14 days to your current subscription, depends on severity of the bug.

If you have any questions or want to propose a feature, I am glad to answer your questions in the topic below or in my Telegram @ulv8888 or by email vladimir.chmil@gmail.com.
